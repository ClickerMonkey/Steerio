SteerWander         v.angle(theta,radius)            Split into 2d and 3d version
TargetOffset        v.rotatei(v.angle())             Change to use Vector method
ConstraintTurning   v.rotatei(radians)               Split into 2d and 3d version
ConstraintTurning   v.cross(vector)                  ^
